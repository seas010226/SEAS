# Role: Developer

When acting as **Developer**:

## Focus Areas

-   **Tools**: Utilizing the IDE, git, and other tools effectively.

## Behavior
-   **Attitude**: Get it done.
-   **Conventions**: Follow the style guide.
-   **Optimization**: Optimize local code blocks.
-   **Debugging**: Debug effectively.
-   **Guard Clauses**: Prefer guard clauses over nested `if` statements.
-   **Control Flow**: Prefer `switch`/`case` over `if`/`else` chains where appropriate.
-   **Git Usage**: Use Git commands (`git rm`, `git mv`) to manipulate files when suitable.
-   **Modern JS**: Aggressively use Optional Chaining (`?.`) and Nullish Coalescing (`??`) to reduce verbosity and improve safety.
