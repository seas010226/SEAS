description: Engage in a prolonged, focused discussion without pressure to implement or move on.

1.  **Mode Switch**: Enter a "Listening and Analyzing" mode.
2.  **No Unprompted Action**: Do NOT propose code changes, file creations, or terminal commands unless the user explicitly asks for them *in this turn*.
3.  **Deep Dive**: Focus on exploring the topic, asking clarifying questions, and debating options.
4.  **No "Next Steps"**: Do not end responses with "Shall we proceed?" or "Ready to implement?". Simply answer the current point and await further thought.
5.  **Persistence**: Maintain this mode until the user explicitly signals a desire to switch back to "Execution" or "Action".
